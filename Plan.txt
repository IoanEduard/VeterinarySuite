basic scheleton is done

09-08-2023
1. Add Identity
    - Admin user is seeded.
    - Admin creates the users and assign roles

    Create User
    Login 
    Recover password

2. Add a homepage in Angular
    Register, Login forms for the client (use a different DTO so it can't pass roles)
    Recover password

Chatgpt question:

I wanna make an application that can be used by many clients, but the ones that buy it should be the owner/admin of it. 
Get Started -> buying license -> Make an Account, it creates an account as an admin.
Then admin creates other users
How do I make available resources for the users that are created by this admin? Do I use something 
like a license of the product when I serve the data?
    
Need to implement a multi-tenant something..
    
Lets just implement today Identity into the project.
    Register
    Login
    Recover Password

    Creating User with role
    Assigning role to user


What works so far:
    Register
    Login
    EmailSenderService
    ConfirmEmail
    Recover Password
    Reset Password

Whats next
    Implement Roles
    Add a business/owner table
    Proper error handling
    Clean and improve methods in account controller

Tenants   
    Add tenant logic for the business/owner
    Tenant can create roles
    Tenant can create users and assign roles
    Users created with a specific tenantId can see only their resources
        - Quick test: 
            Validate the tenantId 
            Add a pacient from two different accounts
            Get data for specific tenants 
Stripe
    Integrate stripe sandbox, very basic endpoints to hit the Stripe sandbox

Licensing
    Implement licensing logic
    Put together with stripe buying a subscription

Chat 

Implement versioning of the application
Plan the modules for the actual application, do the back-end endpoints.
    Pacients 
    Employees 
    Appointments
    Stock
    ..and more


Questionable decisions:
1. Generic repository using void on some methods and calling tolistasync

High level UI flow

1. We have subscription plans
2. User clicks one of them 
3. User will have to register for an account
4. User will submit personal and business information
5. User has to confirm email 
6. User will have to confirm the payment and review what he pays for.
7. Once confirmed, we make a payment to Stripe.
8. If payment successful, user gets a tenantId
9. Provide access to features as user has a valid subscription

Implementation plan.
Implement payment logic that will take a subscription plan ID from the user
Complete the payment so it works in stripe sandbox.

Add user personal and business information tables to the IdentityUser
Create a paymentReview endpoint that will pull from the db what user has submitted so far and is related to the payment

Implement tenancy logic.
